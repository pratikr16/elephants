![A: Mean thermochron temperature (filled circles) tracks meanambient temperature (open circles) through the day. Vertical lineranges represent 95% confidence intervals. B: Mean thermochron temperature (points) at measured ambient temperature, and GLM fits (lines) in each season (cool-dry: blue circles & lines, hot-wet: red triangles & lines). Vertical lineranges and shaded areas (coloured by season) indicate 95% confidence intervals at each point.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/figs/elefigA1.png)
