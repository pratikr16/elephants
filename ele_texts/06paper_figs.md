# Figures and Tables

![**A**: Mean thermochron temperature (filled circles) tracks mean ambient temperature (open circles) through the day. Vertical lineranges represent 95% confidence intervals. **B**: Mean thermochron temperature (points) at measured ambient temperature, and GLM fits (lines) in each season (cool-dry: blue circles & lines, hot-wet: red triangles & lines). Vertical lineranges and shaded areas (coloured by season) indicate 95% confidence intervals at each point.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/fig1temp_loggers.pdf)

![GAMM fit (lines) and mean distance to the nearest water source in each season (point) through the day in each season (cool-dry: blue circles & lines, hot-wet: red triangles & lines). Vertical lineranges and shaded areas (coloured by season) indicate 95% confidence intervals at each point. Only moving elephants included.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/fig2distw_time.pdf)

![**(a)** Temperatures of moving elephants, and **(b)** first passage times (points) at 250m distance intervals from the nearest water source in each season (cool-dry: blue circles, hot-wet: red triangles). Vertical lineranges represent 95% confidence intervals.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/fig3.pdf)

![Mean steplength (points) at 2Â°C temperature intervals in each season (cool-dry: blue circles, hot-wet: red triangles). GAMM fit (lines), data error intervals (lineranges), and fit error intervals (shaded areas) are shown.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/fig4speed.pdf)

![**A**. Mean distance to the point of arrival (bars) in the limnal zone (shaded grey, <500m from water) at each half hour interval over a 24 period (numbers on outside). Zero represents the arrival event, negative values represent hours prior to arrival. Bars are coloured by season (cool-dry: blue, hot-wet: red, overlap: grey). **B**. Mean temperature change (points) and 95% confidence intervals (lineranges) at half-hourly intervals centred on, and relative to, elephant arrival to limnal zone, separated by season (cool-dry: blue circles & lines, hot-wet: red triangles & lines). **C**. Mean temperature change relative to, and centred on, elephant arrival in the limnal zone at half-hourly intervals (y-axis). X-axis shows the true hour of day of each data point. See **fig5b_3d_interactive.html** for an interactive version.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/fig5.pdf)

![**(a)**. Woody density, and **(b)**. Elephant temperature at relocation sites. Values shown are 500m^2^ pooled means. **(c)**. Mean elephant temperatures at woody densities in increments of 5, separated by season (cool dry: blue circles, hot wet: red triangles), showing 95% confidence intervals (lineranges coloured by season.). Rivers (light blue lines) and Kruger boundary (dashed black line) are shown.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/fig6full.pdf)

![Supplementary material: **(a)**. Frequency distributions of distance to the nearest water source (waterhole or river, see separate histograms below), and **(b)**. Frequency distribution of the woody density encountered by elephants.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/figA1.pdf)

![Supplementary material: **A**. Mean woody density (points), and GAM smoothed fit (line) at 100m distance intervals to the nearest water-source. Lineranges and shaded area represent 95% confidence intervals. **B**. Count bins of woody density and distance to water. Darker bins indicate more data points for a given combination.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/woodlands_values.pdf)
