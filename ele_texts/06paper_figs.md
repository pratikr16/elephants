# Figures and Tables

![**(a)** Study site in Kruger National Park, South Africa (red star), showing **(b)** park boundary (dashed grey line), weather station at Skukuza (red star), major rivers (solid blue lines), open waterholes (blue dots), and raw elephant tracks (coloured lines, n = 14). **(c)** Inset showing identified 24-hour looping behaviour centred on water sources (blue dots and lines), coloured by elephant shown (see labels, n = 3), with remaining tracks in the background (grey lines). 500m riparian zone along rivers is shaded green. ](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/ele_fig01.pdf)

![**(a)** Temperature of moving elephants, and **(b)** first passage time out of radius of 200m (points) at 100m distance intervals from the nearest water source in each season (cool-dry: blue circles, hot-wet: red triangles). Vertical lineranges represent 95% confidence intervals.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/fig2.pdf)

![Mean steplength (points) at 2Â°C temperature intervals in each season (cool-dry: blue circles, hot-wet: red triangles). GAMM fit (lines), data error intervals (lineranges), and fit error intervals (shaded areas) are shown.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/fig4speed.pdf)

![Elephants shuttle to water. GAM smooths coloured by season (cool-dry: blue, hot-wet: red) of **(a)** temperature, **(b)** distance to the nearest water source, and **(c)** steplength at stages in elephant revisits to water sources. Elephants are furthest from water at low temperatures, and move fastest in the initial and final 20% of a loop, i.e., when departing and approaching water sources. Only 24-hour loops considered.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/fig0xloops.pdf)

![Elephant shuttling is not driven by woody density. Boxplots (coloured by season, cool-dry: blue, hot-wet: red) overlaid on violin plots (grey, background, pooled over seasons) of the woody density along the stages of elephant revisits to water. Only 24-hour loops considered.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/fig0xloop_woods.pdf)

![**Supplementary material.** Heatmap of fixes per individual, grouped by season and year.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/ele_figA2.pdf)

![**Supplementary material.** Mean thermochron temperature (points) at measured ambient temperature, and GLM fits (lines) in each season (cool-dry: blue circles & lines, hot-wet: red triangles & lines). Vertical lineranges and shaded areas (coloured by season) indicate 95% confidence intervals at each point.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/figA1temp_loggers.pdf)

![**Supplementary material.** GAMM fit (lines) and mean distance to the nearest water source in each season (point) through the day in each season (cool-dry: blue circles & lines, hot-wet: red triangles & lines). Vertical lineranges and shaded areas (coloured by season) indicate 95% confidence intervals at each point. Only moving elephants included.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/fig2distw_time.pdf)

![**Supplementary material.** Distribution of intervals between elephant revisits to water sources.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/fig0xrevisit_dist.pdf)

![**Supplementary material.** Elephants loop at all times. Boxplots of the hour of day at stages of elephant looping behaviour, coloured by season (cool-dry: blue, hot-wet: red). Each loop begins and terminates at a water source. Violin plots of the probability distribution of hour of day at each stage in the loop, pooled over seasons are shown in the background. ](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/fig5looptime.pdf)

![**Supplementary material.** **(A)**. Woody density, and **(B)**. Elephant temperature at relocation sites. Values shown are 500m^2^ pooled means. **(C)**. Mean elephant temperatures at woody densities in increments of 5, separated by season (cool dry: blue circles, hot wet: red triangles), showing 95% confidence intervals (lineranges coloured by season.). Rivers (light blue lines) and Kruger boundary (dashed black line) are shown.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/fig6full.pdf)

![**Supplementary material.** **(a)**. Frequency distributions of distance to the nearest water source (waterhole or river, see separate histograms below), and **(b)**. Frequency distribution of the woody density encountered by elephants.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/figA6.pdf)
