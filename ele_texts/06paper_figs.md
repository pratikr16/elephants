# Figures

![Figure 1. **(a)** Study site in Kruger National Park, South Africa (red star), showing **(b)** park boundary (dashed grey line), weather station at Skukuza (red star), major rivers (solid blue lines), open waterholes (blue dots), and raw elephant tracks (coloured lines, n = 14). **(c)** Inset showing identified 24-hour looping behaviour centred on water sources (blue dots and lines), coloured by elephant shown (see labels, n = 3), with remaining tracks in the background (grey lines). 500m riparian zone along rivers is shaded green. ](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/fig1.png)

![Figure 2. **(a)** Density of displacement along 12,106 elephant tracks between habitual water-points. **(b)** Density of intervals between 12,106 visits to water-points; rectangle bounds 653 intervals of 12 -- 24 hours. **(c)** Distance to water source, **(d)** elephant temperature, and **(e)** elephant speed along 653 elephant tracks between water sources. **(f)** Elephant speed (points) at 2Â°C temperature intervals in each season (cool-dry: blue circles, hot-wet: red triangles). GAMM fit (lines), data error intervals (lineranges), and fit error intervals (shaded areas) are shown.](/home/pratik/git/elephants/ele_code/fig2.png)
