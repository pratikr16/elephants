## Elephant movement

Elephants ranged on average 4005 km (range: 1854 km -- 7074 km) across southern Kruger over the tracking period (figure 1), covering 7.2 km per day (range: 5 km -- 9.9 km) at a speed of 398 m/hr (range: 304 m/hr -- 470 m/hr); logger fixes placed them within 500m of water 12% (range: 6% -- 21%) and 11 % (range: 3% -- 17%) of the time in the cool-dry and hot-wet seasons respectively.

## Elephant temperature

Collar thermochrons reported identical mean daily temperatures of 27.68°C (range: 6°C -- 47°C) and 27.62°C (range: 7°C -- 44°C) in the cool-dry and hot-wet seasons. Thermochron data from 3 elephants logged within 10km of Skukuza were well correlated with temperatures from the weather station in both seasons (mean hourly correlation: cool-dry = 0.77, hot-wet: 0.81), with all hourly correlations ⪆ 0.6.

# Visits to water

Elephants ventured beyond 200m of a relocation after 2.5 hours (range: 0.02 hours -- 10 hours) on their first visit, returning 5 times (range: never -- 86 times), and spent on average 8.65 hours (range: 0.02 -- 55 hours) around each point. Using a combination of conservative levels of FPT 200 (< 2 hours), residence time (> 10 hours), and the number of revisits (> 10 times) 6,711 of 47,186 (14%) relocations within 500m of water sources were identified as habitual water points.

Segments between water points frequently took the form of loops, elephants returning to The interval of visits to water points had a multi-modal distribution, and 1,292 (19%) segments had a water-visit interval between 4 -- 24 hours (figure 2(a), electronic supplementary material table S1).

Elephants moved faster with increasing temperatures (Χ^2^ = 4668, p < 0.01), and also in the hot-wet season (Χ^2^ = 361, p < 0.01); woody density had a negative effect (Χ^2^ = 2347, p < 0.01).
