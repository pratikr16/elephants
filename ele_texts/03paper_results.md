## Elephant movement & temperature

Elephants ranged on average 4005 km (range: 1854 km -- 7074 km) across southern Kruger over the tracking period (figure 1), covering 7.2 km per day (range: 5 km -- 9.9 km) at a speed of 398 m/hr (range: 304 m/hr -- 470 m/hr); logger fixes placed them within 500m of water 12% (range: 6% -- 21%) and 11% (range: 3% -- 17%) of the time in the cool-dry and hot-wet seasons respectively.

Collar thermochrons reported identical mean daily temperatures of 27.68°C (range: 6°C -- 47°C) and 27.62°C (range: 7°C -- 44°C) in the cool-dry and hot-wet seasons. Thermochron data from 3 elephants logged within 10km of Skukuza were well correlated with temperatures from the weather station in both seasons (mean hourly correlation: cool-dry = 0.77, hot-wet: 0.81), with all hourly correlations ⪆ 0.6.

## Visits to water

Elephants ventured beyond 200m of a relocation after 2.5 hours (range: 0.02 hours -- 10 hours) on their first visit, returning to this zone 5 times (range: never -- 86 times), and spent on average 8.65 hours (range: 0.02 -- 55 hours) around each point. Using a combination of conservative levels of residence time (> 10 hours) and the number of revisits (> 10 times) 12,106 (38%) of 32,183 relocations within 500m of water sources were identified as habitual water points.

Segments between water points frequently took the form of loops (figures 1*c*, 2*a*), with elephants returning to within 500m of their start location in ≈ 80% of cases in both seasons (electronic supplementary material table S1). The interval of visits to water points had a multi-modal distribution, and 653 (5%) segments had a water-visit interval between 12 -- 24 hours (figure 2*a*).

Elephants in these sub-24 segments moved away from water as temperatures dropped, and reversed this trend as temperatures rose (figure 2*b, c*). Elephant speed was highest in the initial and final fifths of a segment. An effect of season was also apparent, with elephants experiencing higher temperatures, moving further away from water, and travelling faster in the hot-wet season (figure 2).

Elephant temperature was found to be a significant predictor of speed (Χ^2^ = 4668, p < 0.01); elephants moved faster in the hot-wet season (Χ^2^ = 361, p < 0.01) but more slowly in denser woodland (Χ^2^ = 2347, p < 0.01).
