## Elephant movement and temperatures

Elephants ranged on average 4005 km (range: 1854 km -- 7074 km) across southern Kruger over the tracking period (figure 1), covering 7.2 km per day (range: 5 km -- 9.9 km) at a speed of 398 m/hr (range: 304 m/hr -- 470 m/hr); logger fixes placed them within 500m of water (which we call the limnal zone) 12% (range: 6% -- 21%) and 11 % (range: 3% -- 17%) of the time in the cool-dry and hot-wet seasons respectively.
Elephants ventured beyond 200m of a relocation after 2.5 hours (range: 0.02 hours -- 10 hours) on their first visit, returning 5 times (range: never -- 86 times), and spending on average 8.65 hours (range: 0.02 -- 55 hours) around each point. 6,711 relocations were identified as habitual watering points.

## Elephant temperatures

Collar thermochrons reported identical mean daily temperatures of 27.68°C (range: 6°C -- 47°C) and 27.62°C (range: 7°C -- 44°C) in the cool-dry and hot-wet seasons. Thermochron data from 3 elephants logged within 10km of Skukuza were well correlated with temperatures from the weather station in both seasons (mean hourly correlation: cool-dry = 0.77, hot-wet: 0.81), with all hourly correlations ⪆ 0.6.

Distance to water was a significant predictor of elephant temperature, 

84% of intervals were under 24 hours, and we used these for further analyses.
