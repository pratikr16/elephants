\caption{{\small \emph{a.} Wintering grounds of greater white-fronted geese \emph{Anser a. albifrons} in the Netherlands and northern Germany, with 65 sites (dots) where 51,037 successful families in 1,884 flocks were recorded.
21 splits (diamonds) were observed in 13 GPS tracked families. Shaded
area bounds 10,635 observations of marked geese. Observations correspond well with major rivers and waterbodies, marked in blue. Data were collected
from 2000 - 2017. \emph{b.} Breeding grounds in Russia (ellipse) with Kolguyev
Island (dot) and general direction of migration (arrow) to wintering area
(rectangle).}}
