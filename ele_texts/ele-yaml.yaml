title: Elephants shuttle to thermoregulate
author: Author names and affils
abstract: Overheating is a major concern for large animals, and landscape scale movements to avoid thermal stress may them to select for sites that can act as heat sinks, such as water sources. The movements of the largest land mammal, the savanna elephant (*Loxodonta africana*) have received quite some attention in the context of water dependence. We tracked African elephants in Kruger National Park and tested their movement and identified habitually used water points to test how temperature affects elephant movement. Elephants loop back to water points, being closest to water during the hottest parts of the day, with the greatest displacement from water at the coolest hours. Elephant speeds were highest in the first and last fifths of loops, i.e., in the approaches to and departures from water. Elephants may cover more ground when in search of water, which ha implications for management decisions that rely on water dependence to control their space use.
