Overheating is a major concern for large animals, whose movements to avoid thermal stress may lead to selection for landscape heat-sinks. The apparent thermoregulation driven water dependence of savanna elephants *Loxodonta africana* has received much attention, but a mechanistic understanding of their movements in relation to water sources and ambient conditions, especially temperature, is lacking. This is  partly because reliable measures of animal ambient temperature are missing.
We addressed these lacunae by tracking elephants in South Africa, and testing temperature loggers (thermochrons) on board standard GPS transmitter collars as accurate reporters of elephant thermal landscapes. We identified frequently revisited water points, and tested how temperature affects elephant movement in relation to these sites.
Elephants loop back to water-points, being closest to water during the hottest parts of the day. Elephant speeds were highest when approaching and leaving water. Elephants move faster and farther when hot, which has implications for management decisions that rely on water dependence to control their space use.
