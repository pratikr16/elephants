Overheating is a major concern for large animals, and landscape scale movements to avoid thermal stress may lead to selection for landscape heat-sinks. The movements of savanna elephants *Loxodonta africana* have received much attention in the context of water dependence.
We tracked elephants in South Africa, identified habitual water-points, and tested how temperature affects elephant movement.
Elephants loop back to water-points, being closest to water during the hottest parts of the day. Elephant speeds were highest when approaching and leaving water.
Elephants move faster and farther when hot, which has implications for management decisions that rely on water dependence to control their space use.
