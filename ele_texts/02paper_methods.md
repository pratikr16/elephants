## Elephant movement

We collected half-hourly positions of individual (n = 14) free-ranging female African elephants (*Loxodonta africana*) previously fitted with GPS logger-transmitter collars; each was from a different herd in Kruger National Park, South Africa (24째S, 31.5째E). Elephants were tracked for on average 637 days (range: 436 -- 731) between August 2007 and August 2009 (see figure 1 & electronic supplementary material figure S1).
To relate elephant movement to their landscape, we gathered the following environmental data: courses of park rivers [**cite**], locations of active park waterholes [**cite**].

## Elephant temperature

Collar-borne thermochrons reported temperature data (hereon elephant temperature) at each position fix.
Seeking to verify that thermochrons accurately reflected the thermal environment of elephants, we also collected ambient temperature data from Skukuza weather station (24.98째S, 31.5째E) [**cite**], and tested the hourly correlation of ambient temperatures with elephant temperatures.

# Visits to water and temperature

We calculated the first passage time through (FPT 200), total time spent within (residence time), and the number of revisits within a 200m radius of each relocation, and sought to identify habitual water points.

We then identified track segments between each visit to water points and investigated the frequency of visits, as well as whether the temperature, speed, and distance to the nearest water source throughout the track.
Finally, we used a mixed additive model to test whether elephants moved faster at higher temperatures.
