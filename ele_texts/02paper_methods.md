## Elephant movement

We collected half-hourly positions of individual (n = 14) free-ranging female African elephants (*Loxodonta africana*) previously fitted with GPS logger-transmitter collars; each was from a different herd in Kruger National Park, South Africa (24째S, 31.5째E). Elephants were tracked for on average 637 days (range: 436 -- 731) between August 2007 and August 2009 (see figure 1 & electronic supplementary material figure S1). Collar-borne thermochrons reported temperature data (hereon elephant temperature) at each position fix.

We identified the first passage time through (FPT 200), total time spent within (residence time), and the number of revisits within a 200m radius of each relocation. Using a combination of conservative levels of FPT 200 (< 2 hours), residence time (> 10 hours), and the number of revisits (> 10 times) we classified a subset of relocations within 500m of water sources as habitual watering points.

## Context data

To relate elephant movement to their landscape, we gathered the following environmental data: courses of park rivers [**cite**], locations of active park waterholes [**cite**]. Seeking to verify that thermochrons accurately reflected the thermal environment of elephants, we also collected half-hourly temperature data from Skukuza weather station (24.98째S, 31.5째E) [**cite**].

## Analyses

We first tested the correlation of temperatures reported by the Skukuza weather station with elephant temperatures.
We then used mixed models to relate the elephant temperature and their FPT 200 to their distance from the nearest water source and to the density of woody vegetation. Following preliminary results, we tested whether elephants' temperature was a good predictor of their speed.

Finally, we identified track segments between each visit to watering points and investigated the frequency of visits, as well as whether the temperature, speed, and distance to the nearest water source throughout the track was consistent with earlier analyses.
