# Methods

We collected half-hourly positions of individual (n = 14) free-ranging female African elephants previously fitted with GPS logger-transmitter collars [**cite + collar manufacture + weight**]; each was from a different herd in Kruger National Park, South Africa (24째S, 31.5째E). Elephants were tracked for on average 637 days (range: 436 -- 731) between August 2007 and August 2009 (see figure 1*b* & electronic supplementary material figure S1).
To relate elephant movement to their landscape, we gathered shapefiles of the courses of park rivers, and the locations of active park waterholes.

Collar-borne thermochrons reported temperature data (hereon elephant temperature) at each position fix.
Seeking to verify that thermochrons accurately reflected the thermal environment of elephants, we also collected ambient temperature data from Skukuza weather station (24.98째S, 31.5째E), and tested the hourly correlation of ambient temperatures with elephant temperatures.

We calculated the first passage time through (FPT 200), total time spent within (residence time), and the number of revisits within a 200m radius of each relocation, and sought to identify habitual water points.
We then identified track segments between each visit to water points and characterised the frequency of visits, and, the temperature, speed, and distance to the nearest water source throughout a subset of 24 hour tracks.
Finally, we used a mixed additive model to test whether elephants moved faster at higher temperatures.
